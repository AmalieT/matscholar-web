Matscholar is a research effort based at Lawrence Berkeley National 
Laboratory with the aim of organizing the world's materials knowlegde 
by applying Natural Language Processing (NLP) to materials science
literature. To date, we have extracted and curated useful materials 
data from over 5 million materials abstracts and it is freely 
accessible via our [website](https://www.matscholar.com) and 
[public API](https://github.com/materialsintelligence/matscholar). 

This repo houses the code for the [website](https://www.matscholar.com),
which is built with Plotly Dash.

If you would like to submit feedback to help us improve the app, 
please see the Matscholar category on our [official support forum](https://discuss.matsci.org/c/matscholar). 

If you have any other questions please contact our development 
team at help@matscholar.com.

Matscholar is supported by Toyota Research Institute through the 
Accelerated Materials Design and Discovery program. Abstract data was 
downloaded from the ScienceDirect API between October 2017 and September
 2018, and the Scopus API in July 2019 via http://api.elsevier.com and 
 http://www.scopus.com. Abstract data was also downloaded from the 
 SpringerNature API and Royal Society of Chemistry sources.
